Org is a TODO manager and a day planner.

Turn sections into /tasks/ by adding keywords representing the state of that task. Switch states easily with the keyboard shortcut =S-<left/right>=.

See your tasks in a planner (called an /Agenda/ in Org) by adding timestamps to them. 

All done with just plain text markup. 

Want a different set of keywords? No problem - Org lets you customize them to support your workflow.

* Capturing
  :PROPERTIES:

#+ATTR_HTML: :id main-image
[[file:img/capture.jpg]]




Adding TODO items to your =.org= files is called /capturing/.

You can capture from everywhere, both within Emacs and from other
applications like your web browser, pdf viewer, etc.

Capture templates allow you to tell what information you want to capture
from various contexts (the file name, the current date, the region, etc.)

Org is a great plain-text table editor.

You can import tables from =.csv= and =.tsv= files, or directly from the
current buffer; you can then export them in all the formats supported by
Org (see below).

Org can also be used as a /spreadsheet/ system.  

You can add formulas using the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html][Calc Emacs package]] or Emacs lisp code.

Org is an authoring and publication tool.

You can use intuitive markup then have it converted to =HTML=, $\LaTeX{}$,
=ODT= -- and much more.

Developers can easily create new backends for their favorite format (see
the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html][reference documentation]]).

You can also define /publishing projects/ with one or more =.org= file(s),
and one or more publication backends.

You can insert code snippets, have them fontified in the Org buffer,
compute the results in-file and tangle your Org file to get a code source
file.
