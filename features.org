You can import tables from =.csv= and =.tsv= files, or directly from the
current buffer; you can then export them in all the formats supported by
Org (see below).

Org can also be used as a /spreadsheet/ system.  

You can add formulas using the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html][Calc Emacs package]] or Emacs lisp code.

*Org is an authoring and publication tool.* 

Org doesn't have to be used for TODO list management and dayplanning. 

Use the intutive Org markup syntax to create source documents that can exported into many different formats including:
- =HTML=
- $\LaTeX{}$
- =ODT=
- and much more!

Developers can easily create new backends for their favorite format (see
the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html][reference documentation]]).

You can also define /publishing projects/ with one or more =.org= file(s),
and one or more publication backends.
